# FEA-Physics_IA

Physics IA. Testing relationship of voltage of power supply (capacitor bank) vs initial velocity of armature of an EM mass driver.

FEA Software used here is LS-Dyna. Files are made in Blender, then Autodesk Fusion 360 to generate face groups and convert to .STEP file, and then meshing and run simulation.
